# Hestia Sample App

This is a sample app demonstrating the Hestia C++ API use with Autoconf

```bash
cd $PATH_TO_SOURCE
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```

If hestia is in a non-standard location do:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$INSTALL_DIR/lib/pkgconfig
```

If there are issues loading libraries at runtime try adding `$INSTALL_DIR/lib` to the system library search paths.
